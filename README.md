# snake_game_project
Developed a classic arcade-style Snake Game using Python and the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves across the screen to eat randomly appearing apples. Each apple eaten increases the snake’s length and speed, challenging the player to maintain control and avoid collisions with the game boundaries or the snake’s own body. Implemented features include dynamic score tracking, collision detection, and smooth keyboard-based movement.
